/// Initialize a cinematic detection.
///
/// For playback and edit, most detections are obtained by from the cinematic script rather than being created.
/// However, if you need to add a custom track, you can build an array of detections to create one.
/// Any detections you create will not have a valid detectionID until the custom track is added to the cinematic script.
/// Doing so will return the assigned detectionID. Any detections newly obtained from the cinematic script will have their assigned detectionID.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - time: the presentation time of the frame in which the detection occurred
///   - detectionType: the type of object that was detected (face, torso, cat, dog, etc.)
///   - normalizedRect: the rectangle within the image where the object occurs, normalized such that (0.0, 0.0) is the top-left and (1.0, 1.0) is the bottom-right
///   - focusDisparity: the disparity to use in order to focus on the object (use the static `disparity` method to compute if unknown)
