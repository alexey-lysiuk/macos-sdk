/// @brief Whether the user has enrolled this biometry.

/// @brief Whether biometry is locked out.
/// @discussion The system might lock the user out of biometry for various reasons. For example, with Face ID, the user is
///             locked out after 5 failed match attempts in row. To recover from bio lockout, users need to enter their passcode
///             (e.g. during device ulock).

/// @brief The application specific state of the biometric enrollment as returned by @c LAContext.domainState.biometry.stateHash
/// @discussion This value represents the state of the enrollment and changes whenever the biometric enrollment is changed.
///             It does not directly map to the enrolled templates, e.g. if a finger is added to Touch ID enrollement and then
///             removed, the final state would be different.
///             It also returns different values to different apps to prevent tracking of user identity.

/// @brief Whether the built in biometric sensor is inaccessible in the current configuration, preventing the use of biometry.
/// @discussion Currently, the only example of this is a Clamshell Mode on macOS. The user will be not able to use Touch ID
///             if the MacBook lid is closed while connected to external monitor and keyboard, unless the external keyboard
///             has Touch ID.
