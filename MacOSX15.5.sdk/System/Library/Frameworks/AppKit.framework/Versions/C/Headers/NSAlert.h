/* These are additional `NSModalResponse` values used by `NSAlert`’s `-runModal` and `-beginSheetModalForWindow:completionHandler:`.

 first (rightmost) button = NSAlertFirstButtonReturn
 second button = NSAlertSecondButtonReturn
 third button = NSAlertThirdButtonReturn
 buttonPosition 3+x = NSAlertThirdButtonReturn + x

 Note that these return values do not apply to an `NSAlert` created via `+alertWithMessageText:defaultButton:alternateButton:otherButton:informativeTextWithFormat:`, which instead uses the same return values as `NSRunAlertPanel`. See `NSAlertDefaultReturn`, etc. in NSPanel.h
 
 If an alert is presented with no buttons added via `-addButtonWithTitle:`, the implicitly-created OK button will return with response code of 0.
