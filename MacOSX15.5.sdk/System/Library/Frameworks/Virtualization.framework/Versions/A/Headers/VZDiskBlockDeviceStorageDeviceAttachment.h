 @abstract Storage device attachment using a disk block device to store data.
 @discussion
    The disk block device implements a storage attachment by using an actual disk rather than a disk image on a file system.

    For example, a disk block device on the disk at `/dev/rdisk42` would execute the I/O operations directly on that disk
    rather than through a file system.

    Note that if the disk has a file system formatted on it, the guest is able to destroy data in a way that is not recoverable.
    The disk passed to this attachment needs to be handled with caution.

    An example use of this API is:
    ```
    NSFileHandle *fileHandle = [NSFileHandle fileHandleForReadingAtPath:@"/dev/rdisk42"];
    if (!fileHandle) {
        // Handle errors.
    }

    NSError *error;
    VZDiskBlockDeviceStorageDeviceAttachment *attachment =
        [[VZDiskBlockDeviceStorageDeviceAttachment alloc] initWithFileHandle:fileHandle
                                                                     readOnly:YES
                                                          synchronizationMode:VZDiskSynchronizationModeFull
                                                                        error:error];
    if (!attachment) {
        // Handle errors.
    }
    ```

    Disk file handles are typically only accessible by the `root` user unless permission is explicitly granted.
    Running virtual machines as root is not recommended. If `root` access is required to open the file descriptor, it is recommended to do that operation
    in a separate process then pass the file descriptor to a less privileged process running Virtualization framework.

 @discussion
    The file handle is retained by the disk attachment.
    The handle must be open when the virtual machine starts.

    The `readOnly` parameter affects how the disk is exposed to the guest operating system
    by the storage controller. If the disk is intended to be used read-only, it is also recommended
    to open the file handle as read-only.
