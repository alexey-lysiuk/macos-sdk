@protocol VZNetworkBlockDeviceStorageDeviceAttachmentDelegate;

/*!
 @abstract Storage device attachment backed by a Network Block Device (NBD) client.
 @discussion
    This storage device attachment provides an NBD client implementation. The NBD client is connected
    to an NBD server referred to by an NBD Uniform Resource Indicator (URI), represented as an URL in
    this API. The NBD server runs outside of Virtualization framework and is not controlled by
    Virtualization framework. The NBD client forwards the guest's I/O operations to the NBD server,
    where the I/O operations are handled.

    The NBD client will attempt to connect to the NBD server referred to by the URL when you start the virtual
    machine (e.g. when `[VZVirtualMachine startWithCompletionHandler:]` is called). A connection attempt is NOT
    made when the attachment object is initialized. Reconnection attempts will take place throughout the life
    cycle of the virtual machine when the NBD client encounters a recoverable error such as connection timeout
    and unexpected connection errors. The NBD client will disconnect from the server when the virtual machine
    shuts down.

    Using this attachment requires the app to have the "com.apple.security.network.client" entitlement as this attachment opens an outgoing
    network connection.

    For more information about NBD, see https://github.com/NetworkBlockDevice/nbd/blob/master/doc/proto.md.
    For more information about the NBD URL format, see https://github.com/NetworkBlockDevice/nbd/blob/master/doc/uri.md.

    An example use of this API is:
    ```
    NSURL *url = [[NSURL alloc] initWithString:@"nbd://localhost:10809/myDisk"]
    NSError *error = nil;
    VZNetworkBlockDeviceStorageDeviceAttachment *attachment =
        [[VZNetworkBlockDeviceStorageDeviceAttachment alloc] initWithURL:url
                                                                 timeout:5.0
                                                          forcedReadOnly:NO
                                                     synchronizationMode:VZDiskSynchronizationModeFull
                                                                   error:&error];

    if (!attachment) {
        // Handle the `error`.
    }

    VZVirtioBlockDeviceConfiguration *blockDevice = [[VZVirtioBlockDeviceConfiguration alloc] initWithAttachment:attachment];
    ```

 @param URL The URL referring to the NBD server to which the NBD client is to be connected.
 @param timeout The timeout value in seconds for the connection between the client and server. When the timeout expires, an attempt to reconnect with the server will take place.

    The `forcedReadOnly` parameter affects how the NBD client is exposed to the guest operating system
    by the storage controller. As part of the NBD protocol, whether or not the disk exposed by the NBD client is
    read-only is advertised by the NBD server during the handshake phase of the protocol. Setting `forcedReadOnly`
    to YES will force the NBD client to show up as read-only to the guest regardless of whether or not the NBD
    server advertises itself as read-only.
