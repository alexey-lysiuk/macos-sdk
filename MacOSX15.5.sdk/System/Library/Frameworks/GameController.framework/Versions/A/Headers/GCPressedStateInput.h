/**
 Buttons are mostly used in a digital sense, thus we have a recommended method
 for checking for pressed state instead of interpreting the value.
 
 As a general guideline a button is pressed if the value exceeds 0. However
 there may be hysteresis applied to counter noisy input values, thus incidental
 values around the threshold value may not trigger a change in pressed state.
 
 Other buttons may support two-stage actuation, where the button reports a
 value between 0 and 1 but is only considered pressed when its value is greater
 than some threshold other than 0.
