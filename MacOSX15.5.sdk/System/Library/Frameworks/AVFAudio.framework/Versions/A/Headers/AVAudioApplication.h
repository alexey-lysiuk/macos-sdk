	@brief  Provide a block that implements your app's input (microphone) muting logic (macOS only). The block will be called
			whenever the input mute state changes, either due to changing the `AVAudioApplication.inputMute` property on
			this API, or due to a Bluetooth audio accessory gesture (certain AirPods / Beats headphones) changing the mute state.

	@param	inputMuteHandler block that will be called upon every input mute state change. If the boolean `inputShouldBeMuted`
			is true, your block should mute all input/microphone samples until the next time the handler is called. Your block should return
			a value of YES if successful, or in exceptional cases return a NO value if the mute action was unsuccesful.
			Since the input mute handling logic should happen a single place, subsequent calls to this method will overwrite any previously
			registered block with the one provided. A nil value may be provided to cancel the block being called, e.g. at end of call lifecycle.

	@note   This is available on macOS only - for all other platforms input muting will be handled internally. It is recommended only to
			perform your input muting logic within this block, and to perform your UI updates for input mute state changes within the handler
			for AVAudioApplicationInputMuteStateChangeNotification. This handler should be set by the process doing the call's audio I/O.
