/// You can have multiple instances of `CKSyncEngine` in the same process, each targeting a different database.
/// For example, you might have one for your private database and one for your shared database.
///
/// It's also technically possible to have multiple instances of `CKSyncEngine` for the same `CKDatabase`.
/// This isn't recommended for production code, but it can be helpful for testing your `CKSyncEngine` integration.
/// For example, you might make multiple `CKSyncEngine` instances to simulate multiple devices syncing back and forth.

/// Whether or not the sync engine should automatically sync on your behalf.
///
/// If true, then the sync engine will automatically sync using the system scheduler. This is the default value.
/// When you add pending changes to the state, the sync engine will automatically schedule a sync task to send changes.
/// When it receives a notification about new changes on the server, it will automatically schedule a sync task to fetch changes.
/// It will also automatically re-schedule sync tasks for retryable errors such as network failures or server throttles.
///
/// If `automaticallySync` is off, then the sync engine will not perform any operations unless you tell it to do so via `fetchChanges` or `sendChanges`.
///
/// Most applications likely want to enable automatic syncing during normal use.
/// However, you might want to disable it if you have specific requirements for when you want to sync.
/// For example, if you want to sync only once per day, you can turn off automatic sync and manually call `fetchChanges` and `sendChanges` once per day.
///
/// You might also disable automatic sync when writing automated tests for your integration with `CKSyncEngine`.
/// This way, you can have fine grained control over exactly when the sync engine fetches or sends changes.
/// This allows you to simulate edge cases and deterministically test your logic around scenarios like conflict resolution and error handling.

/// If you're migrating to `CKSyncEngine` from a custom CloudKit sync implementation, you can specify your previous subscription ID here.
/// This allows your `CKSyncEngine` integration to be backward compatible with previous versions of your app.
///
/// >Note: `CKSyncEngine` will automatically attempt to discover any previous database subscriptions,
/// but you can be more explicit by giving the subscription ID through this configuration option.
