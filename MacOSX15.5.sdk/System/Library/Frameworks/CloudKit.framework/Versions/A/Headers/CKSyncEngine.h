/// `CKSyncEngine` encapsulates the logic of syncing data with a CloudKit database.
///
/// Syncing with CloudKit involves many moving pieces.
/// Apps need to schedule syncs, create and batch operations, subscribe to database changes,
/// listen for push notifications, store sync state, handle a multitude of errors, and more.
/// `CKSyncEngine` is designed to encapsulate this logic in a higher-level API.
///
/// # Start Your Sync Engine
///
/// Generally, you should initialize your `CKSyncEngine` soon after your process launches.
/// The sync engine will perform work in the background on your behalf, and it needs to be initialized
/// so that it can properly listen for push notifications and handle scheduled sync tasks.
///
/// When initializing your sync engine, you need to provide an object conforming to the ``CKSyncEngineDelegate`` protocol.
/// This protocol is the main method of communication between the sync engine and your app.
/// You also need to provide your last known version of the ``CKSyncEngine/State/Serialization``.
/// See ``CKSyncEngine/State`` and ``Event/StateUpdate`` for more details on the sync engine state.
///
/// Note that before using `CKSyncEngine` in your app, you need to add the CloudKit and remote notification capabilities.
///
/// # Sending Changes to the Server
///
/// In order to send changes to the server, you first need to tell the sync engine you have pending changes to send.
/// You can do this by adding pending changes to the sync engine's ``CKSyncEngine/state`` property.
///
/// When you add pending changes to the state, the sync engine will schedule a task to sync.
/// When the sync task runs, the sync engine will start sending changes to the server.
/// The sync engine will automatically send database changes from ``State/pendingDatabaseChanges``, but you need to provide the record zone changes yourself.
/// In order to send record zone changes, you need to return them from ``CKSyncEngineDelegate/nextRecordZoneChangeBatch(_:syncEngine:)``.
///
/// When the sync engine finishes sending a batch of changes to the server,
/// your `CKSyncEngineDelegate` will receive ``Event/sentDatabaseChanges(_:)`` and ``Event/sentRecordZoneChanges(_:)`` events.
/// These events will notify you of the success or failure of the changes you tried to send.
///
/// At a high level, sending changes to the server happens with the following order of operations:
///
/// 1. You add pending changes to ``CKSyncEngine/state``.
/// 2. You receive ``Event/willSendChanges(_:)`` in ``CKSyncEngineDelegate/handleEvent(_:syncEngine:)``
/// 3. If there are pending database changes, the sync engine sends the next batch.
/// 4. If any database changes were sent, your delegate receives``Event/sentDatabaseChanges(_:)``.
/// 5. Repeat from step 3 until all pending database changes are sent, then move on to record zone changes in step 6.
/// 6. The sync engine asks for the next batch of record zone changes by calling ``CKSyncEngineDelegate/nextRecordZoneChangeBatchToSend(_:syncEngine:)``.
/// 7. The sync engine sends the next record zone change batch to the server.
/// 8. If any record zone changes were sent, your delegate receives ``Event/sentRecordZoneChanges(_:)``.
/// 9. If you added any pending database changes during steps 6-8, the sync engine repeats from step 3. Otherwise, it repeats from step 6.
/// 10. When all pending changes are sent, your delegate receives ``Event/didSendChanges(_:)``.
///
/// # Fetching Changes from the Server
///
/// The sync engine will automatically listen for remote notifications, and it will fetch changes from the server when necessary.
/// Generally, you'll receive events in this order:
///
/// 1. Your delegate receives ``Event/willFetchChanges(_:)``.
/// 2. If there are new database changes to fetch, you receive batches of them in ``Event/fetchedDatabaseChanges(_:)`` events.
/// 3. If there are new record zone changes to fetch, you will receive ``Event/willFetchRecordZoneChanges(_:)`` for each zone that has new changes.
/// 4. The sync engine fetches record zone changes and gives you batches of them in ``Event/fetchedRecordZoneChanges(_:)`` events.
/// 5. Your delegate receives ``Event/didFetchRecordZoneChanges(_:)`` for each zone that had changes to fetch.
/// 6. Your delegate receives ``Event/didFetchChanges(_:)``, indicating that sync engine has finished fetching changes.
///
/// # Sync Scheduling
///
/// ## Automatic sync
///
/// By default, the sync engine will automatically schedule sync tasks on your behalf.
/// If the user is signed in, the device has a network connection, and the system is generally in a good state, these scheduled syncs will happen relatively quickly.
/// However, if the device has no network, is low on power, or is otherwise under a heavy load, these automatic syncs might be delayed.
/// Similarly, if the user isn't signed in to an account, the sync engine won't perform any sync tasks at all.
///
/// ## Manual sync
///
/// Generally, you should rely on this automatic sync behavior, but there may be some cases where you want to manually trigger a sync.
/// For example, if you have a pull-to-refresh UI, you can call ``CKSyncEngine/fetchChanges(_:)`` to tell the sync engine to fetch immediately.
/// Or if you want to provide some sort of "backup now" button, you can call ``CKSyncEngine/sendChanges(_:)`` to send to the server immediately.
///
/// ### Testing
///
/// These manual sync functions might also be useful during automated testing.
/// When writing automated tests, you can turn off automatic sync via ``CKSyncEngine/Configuration/automaticallySync``.
/// Then, you'll have complete control over the ordering of sync events.
/// This allows you to interject behavior in the sync flow and simulate specific sequences of events.
///
/// # Error Handling
///
/// There are some transient errors that the sync engine will handle automatically behind the scenes.
/// The sync engine will retry the operations for these transient errors automatically when it makes sense to do so.
/// Specifically, the sync engine will handle the following errors on your behalf:
///
/// * ``CKErrorCode/notAuthenticated``
/// * ``CKErrorCode/accountTemporarilyUnavailable``
/// * ``CKErrorCode/networkFailure``
/// * ``CKErrorCode/networkUnavailable``
/// * ``CKErrorCode/requestRateLimited``
/// * ``CKErrorCode/serviceUnavailable``
/// * ``CKErrorCode/zoneBusy``
///
/// When the sync engine encounters one of these errors, it will wait for the system to be in a good state and try again.
/// For example, if the server sends back a `.requestRateLimited` error, the sync engine will respect this throttle and try again after the retry-after time.
///
/// `CKSyncEngine` will _not_ handle errors that require application-specific logic.
/// For example, if you try to save a record and get a ``CKErrorCode/serverRecordChanged``, you need to handle that error yourself.
/// There are plenty of errors that the sync engine cannot handle on your behalf, see ``CKErrorCode`` for a list of all the possible errors.
///
/// # Accounts
///
/// `CKSyncEngine` monitors for account status, and it will only sync if there's an account signed in.
/// Because of this, you can initialize your `CKSyncEngine` at any time, regardless of account status.
/// If there is no account, or if the user disabled sync in settings, the sync engine will stay dormant in the background.
/// Once an account is available, the sync engine will start syncing automatically.
///
/// It will also listen for when the user signs in or out of their account.
/// When it notices an account change, it will send an ``Event/accountChange(_:)`` to your delegate.
/// It's your responsibility to react appropriately to this change and update your local persistence.
