/// Each UI update consists of several phases which run in order, one after another. There are two phase groups - normal
/// and low-latency. Normal phase group consists of phases from `EventDispatch` to `CATransactionCommit`. Low-latency
/// phase group consists of phases from `LowLatencyEventDispatch` to `LowLatencyCATransactionCommit`. When phase group
/// runs, all phases inside the group run. Phases run one after another in the specified order without exiting back into
/// the run loop. Spinning a nested run loop inside any of the phases is not supported. For each UI update, normal phase
/// group always runs. Low-latency phase group is optional and is off by default. It will run only when application
/// explicitly requests low-latency event delivery. Be aware that handling low-level events is extremely demanding and
/// only well profiled and optimized applications can benefit from it. Applications that were not designed to handle
/// low-latency events will most likely drop frames. Also not all event types are eligible for low-latency event
/// delivery. Currently only pencil events are low-latency eligible. This practically means that only pencil drawing
/// and writing applications should request it.
/// It's acceptable to block main thread in any of the phases to wait for things that are absolutely required to
/// proceed. When done properly, this will donate main thread priority to the thread being waited for, making it more
/// likely to get those things in time and meet the completion deadline. Of course, extreme caution should be exercised
/// when doing so - maximum wait time should have a hard limit on it that still allows to complete the remaining part
/// of the UI update before completion deadline. Use of `-[CAMetalLayer nextDrawable]` is of a particular note - it's
/// not advised to use it on the main thread of the UI application as it might block main thread for one or more frames.
/// Instead, consider calling `-[CAMetalLayer nextDrawable]` on the background thread and block main thread manually
/// in one of the phases. Use small timeout that allows for UI update to proceed without a new drawable and still finish
/// before the completion deadline.
