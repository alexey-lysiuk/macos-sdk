 *
 * @return es_return_t A value indicating whether or not muting was inverted
 *
 * @discussion Inverting muting can be used to create a client that monitors a specific process(es) or set of directories
 * When muting is inverted it still combines with other types of muting using OR, and inversion happens first.
 * Consider a series of inputs for a system where pid 12 is muted, process muting is inverted, and /bin/bash is also path muted:
 *   (12, /bin/foo)  MATCHING (true, false)  INVERSION (false, false) || false → event is not suppressed
 *   (13, /bin/foo)  MATCHING (false, false) INVERSION (true, false)  || true  → event is suppressed
 *   (12, /bin/bash) MATCHING (true, true)   INVERSION (false, true)  || true  → event is suppressed
 *
 *   Note that because muting is combined using OR even when pid 12 is being selected using inverted process muting,
 *   (12, /bin/bash) is still suppressed because the path is muted
 *
 * The relationship between all three types of muting (proc,path,target-path) and how each can be inverted is complex.
 * The below flow chart explains in detail exactly how muting is applied in the kernel:

 * @note Mute inversion does NOT clear the default mute set.
 * When a new `es_client_t` is created certain paths are muted by default.
 * This is known as "the default mute set".
 * The default mute set exists to protect ES clients from deadlocks, and to prevent watchdog timeout panics.
 * Creating a new client and calling `es_invert_muting(c, ES_MUTE_INVERSION_TYPE_PATH)` will result in the default mute set being
 * selected rather than muted. In most cases this is unintended. Consider calling `es_unmute_all_paths` before inverting process
 * path muting. Consider calling `es_unmute_all_target_paths` before inverting target path muting. Make sure the client has no
 * auth subscriptions before doing so. If desired the default mute set can be saved using `es_muted_paths_events` and then
 * restored after inverting again.

 *             Messages can be responded to out of order by returning control before calling es_respond_*.
 *             The es_message_t is only guaranteed to live as long as the scope it is passed into.
 *             The memory for the given es_message_t is NOT owned by clients and it must not be freed.
 *             For out of order responding the handler must retain the message with es_retain_message.

 *             The application calling this interface must also be approved by users via Transparency, Consent & Control
 *             (TCC) mechanisms using the Privacy Preferences pane and adding the application to Full Disk Access.
 *             When a new client is successfully created, all cached results are automatically cleared.
 *
 * @note When a new client is initialized, there will be a set of paths and a subset of `es_event_type_t` events that are
 *       automatically muted by default. Generally, most AUTH event variants are muted but NOTIFY event variants will
 *       still be sent to the client. The set of paths muted by default are ones that can have an extremely negative impact to
 *       end users if their AUTH events are not allowed in a timely manner (for example, executable paths for processes
 *       that are monitored by the watchdogd daemon). It is important to understand that this list is *not* exhaustive and
 *       developers using the EndpointSecurity framework can still interfere with critical system components and must use
 *       caution to limit user impact. The set of default muted paths and event types may change across macOS releases.
 *       It is possible to both inspect and unmute the set of default muted paths and associated event types using the
 *       appropriate mute-related API, however it is not recommended to unmute these items.
 *
 * @note The only supported way to check if an application is properly TCC authorized for Full Disk Access
 *       is to call es_new_client and handling ES_NEW_CLIENT_RESULT_ERR_NOT_PERMITTED in a way appropriate
 *       to your application.  Most applications will want to ask the user for TCC authorization when
 *       es_new_client returns ES_NEW_CLIENT_RESULT_ERR_NOT_PERMITTED.
 *       To direct the user to the Full Disk Access section in System Settings, applications can use the following URLs:
 *       `x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.settings.PrivacySecurity.extension?Privacy_AllFiles` (macOS 13 and later)
 *       `x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security?Privacy_AllFiles` (until macOS 12)
 *       Applications are advised to use the new URL in macOS 13 as the old one may stop working in a future release.
