.Op Fl B Ar Bonjour name \" [-C Bonjour name]
.Op Fl C Ar configuration URL \" [-C configuration URL]
.Op Fl c Ar filename \" [-c filename]

.Op Fl S Ar port \" [-S port]
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
allows for measuring the different aspects of Network Quality, including:
.Pp
Maximal capacity (often described as speed)
.Pp
The responsiveness of the connection. Responsiveness measures the quality of your network by the number of roundtrips completed per minute (RPM) under working conditions. See
.Ar https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212313
.Pp
Other aspects of the connection that affect the quality of experience.
.Pp
\fBNOTE\fR: This tool will connect to the Internet to perform its tests. This will use data on your Internet service plan.
.Pp
For more details about the RPM score and the methodology around the testing, see
.Ar https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-cpaasch-ippm-responsiveness/
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Fl b
Show Bonjour advertised networkQuality servers
.It Fl B Ar Bonjour name
Run against specified Bonjour instance
.It Fl C Ar configuration URL/path
Use custom configuration URL or path (with scheme file://). See
.Ar https://github.com/network-quality/server
for server implementation details.
.It Fl f Ar <option[,<option>,...]>
Force usage of a specific protocol selection:
.br
   h1: To enforce HTTP/1.1
.br
   h2: To enforce HTTP/2
.br
   h3: To enforce HTTP/3 (QUIC)
.br
   L4S: To force-enable L4S
.br
   noL4S: To force-disable L4S
.It Fl I Ar interface
Bind test to interface (e.g., en0, pdp_ip0,...)
.Pp
If not specified, the default interface will be used.
.It Fl r Ar host
Connect to host or IP, overriding DNS for initial config request
.It Fl S Ar port
Create a networkQuality server-instance running locally on the specified port.
It will display the URL of the config-file that can be passed on to a client-instance
with option -C. Note that the certificate is self-signed and thus option -k needs
to be used on the client-instance.
.It Fl c Ar [\fIfilename\fP ]
Produce computer-readable output (JSON). \fIfilename\fP is optional, will default to STDOUT.
.It Fl d
Do not run a download test (implies -s)
.It Fl h
Show help
.It Fl k
Disable verification of the server identity via TLS.
.It Fl p
Use iCloud Private Relay.
.It Fl s
Run tests sequentially instead of parallel upload/download.
.It Fl u
Do not run an upload test (implies -s)
.It Fl v
Verbose output.
