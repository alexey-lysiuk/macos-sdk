.Dt REBOOT 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm halt ,
.Nm reboot
.Nd stopping and restarting the system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm halt
.Op Fl lNnq
.Nm reboot
.Op Fl lNnq
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
and
.Nm reboot
utilities flush the file system cache to disk, send all running processes
a
.Dv SIGTERM
(and subsequently a
.Dv SIGKILL )
and, respectively, halt or restart the system.
The action is logged, including entering a shutdown record into the user
accounting database.
.Pp
When the system is halted with the halt command, the system is powered off.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl l
The halt or reboot is
.Em not
logged to the system log.
This option is intended for applications such as
.Xr shutdown 8 ,
that call
.Nm
or
.Nm reboot
and log this themselves.
.It Fl N
The file system cache is not flushed during the initial process clean-up,
however the kernel level
.Xr reboot 2
is still processed with a sync.
This option can be useful for performing a
.Dq best-effort
reboot when devices might be unavailable.
This can happen when devices have been disconnected.
.It Fl n
The file system cache is not flushed.
This option should probably not be used.
.It Fl q
The system is halted or restarted quickly and ungracefully, and only
the flushing of the file system cache is performed (if the
.Fl n
option is not specified).
This option should probably not be used.
.El
.Pp
Normally, the
.Xr shutdown 8
utility is used when the system needs to be halted or restarted, giving
users advance warning of their impending doom and cleanly terminating
specific programs.
.Sh SIGTERM TO SIGKILL INTERVAL
The
.Dv SIGKILL
will follow the
.Dv SIGTERM
by an intentionally indeterminate period of time.
Programs are expected to take only enough time to flush all dirty data and exit.
Developers are encouraged to file a bug with the OS vendor, should they encounter an issue with this functionality.

utility appeared in
