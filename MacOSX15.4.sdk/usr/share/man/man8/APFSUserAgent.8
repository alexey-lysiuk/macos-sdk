.Os "Mac OS X"
.Sh NAME
.Nm APFSUserAgent
.Nd APFS new container observer
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
watches for IOKit notifications about new APFS containers appearing, and about volume hash mismatch.
.Pp
If
.Nm
finds a new container with an encrypted volume, it will pop up a DiskUnlock dialog to ask the user for volume unlock password.
.Pp
The
.Nm
can display the following notifications:
.br
\fBIncompatible Features\fP - Mounting the device (volume or container) was rejected because it uses features that are not supported by the current version of macOS. Updating to a newer version of macOS may allow the device to mount.
.br
\fBVolume Hash Mismatch\fP - The cryptographic integrity of the volume is not valid. Reinstalling macOS on this volume will fix its integrity.
.Pp
The
.Nm
uses the
.Ar defaults
bundle \fBcom.apple.APFSUserAgent\fP in order to control whether or not to pop notifications or automatically ask the user to unlock an encrypted volume.
.br
The settings are controlled globally - for all devices, or locally - for a specific volume or container, identified by its UUID.
In the
.Ar defaults
dictionary, the key is the action that the user would like to mute, and the value is the date to mute up to.
.Nm
Will use the system timezone.
.Pp
The values in the
.Ar defaults
dictionary could be updated using the
.Ar defaults
cli as well.
.Sh KEYS
The bundle keys are as follows:
.Bl -hang -offset indent
.It \fBIncompatibleFeatures\fP
Mute notifications about either a volume or a container that has features which are not supported with the current running OS.
.br
.It \fBHashMismatch\fP
Mute notification about volume hash mismatch.
.br
.It \fBDontUnlockVolume\fP
Disable the DiskUnlock dialog to ask the user for volume unlock password.
.br
.It \fBMuteAllNotifications\fP
Mute all APFS notifications. Does not include the dialog to unlock a volume.
.Sh EXAMPLE
The following setting mutes the
.Ar HashMismatch
notification only for the volume with UUID \fBF55502F4-1A9E-4B48-8A11-106E1226AE2F\fP up to 2021-08-18 15:10:31, and mutes the
.Ar IncompatibleFeatures
notification for any device, up to 2021-08-18 15:09:43
