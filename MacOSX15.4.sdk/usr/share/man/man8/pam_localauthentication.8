.Nm pam_localauthentication
.Nd LocalAuthentication PAM module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Ar service-name
.Ar function-class
.Ar control-flag
pam_localauthentication
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The LocalAuthentication PAM module supports the authentication function class,
.Ar function-class
parameter is
.Dq auth .
.Ss The LocalAuthentication Authentication Module
The LocalAuthentication authentication module permits or denies authentication based on LAContext policy evaluation.
.Pp
The module will try to create LAContext from the externalized blob returned by previous invocation of
.Dq LAContext.externalizedContext .
The blob will be queried by
.Xr pam_get_data 3
as data named
.Dq token_la .
.Pp
When the LAContext instance is successfully created, the module will try to evaluate
.Dq LAPolicyDeviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics
on it with user interaction disabled. The expectation is that the policy was already successfully evaluated before. If so, then the authentication performed by this module will succeed as well.
.Pp
The following options may be passed to this authentication module:
.Bl -tag
.It Cm continuityunlock
Use the alternative LAContext for AppleWatch unlock. The LAContext blob will be queried by
.Xr pam_get_data 3
as data named
.Dq token_lacont
and the policy evaluated will be
.Dq LAPolicyContinuityUnlock .
