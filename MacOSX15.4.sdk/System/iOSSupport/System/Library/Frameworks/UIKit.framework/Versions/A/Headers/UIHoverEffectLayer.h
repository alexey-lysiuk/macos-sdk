/// A layer type that can be used to apply a hover effect to its sublayers.
///
/// This layer type is useful for adding hover effects to an existing
/// ``CALayer`` hierarchy. Where possible, use ``UIView.hoverStyle`` instead.
///
/// A ``UIHoverEffectLayer`` is configured with:
///
/// 1. A container ``UIView``, which is used to infer some properties of the
///    hover effect from its trait collection and to allow some aspects of the
///    hover effect to behave correctly. This view's layer should be an ancestor
///    layer of the ``UIHoverEffectLayer``.
/// 2. A ``UIHoverStyle``, which describes the effect to use and the shape of
///    that effect. You then add your content layers that should receive a hover
///    effect as sublayers of this layer.
///
/// ``UIHoverEffectLayer`` may add its own internal sublayers as background or
/// overlay layers relative to your content sublayers. To preserve the correct
/// appearance of the effect, these internal sublayers are automatically sorted
/// accordingly within the layer's layout pass. As such, do not assume that the
/// indices of your content sublayers will remain stable throughout the lifetime
/// of the layer.
///
/// - Note: Not all ``UIHoverStyle``s may be supported by
///   ``UIHoverEffectLayer``. If the provided style is not supported, a fallback
///   style will be selected instead.
