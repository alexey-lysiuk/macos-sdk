// UIHoverGestureRecognizer
// On macOS or iPadOS, this gesture recognizer will begin recognition when the cursor
// (while no mouse buttons are pressed) enters its view, changes during movement
// within the view and ends when the cursor leaves said view.
// Note: While buttons are pressed any currently active hover gesture recognizers
// are effectively paused (letting other gesture recognizers work) until all
// mouse buttons have been released.
//
// On iOS, this gesture recognizer doesn't recognize anything and is effectively
// a no-op.
