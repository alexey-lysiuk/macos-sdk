/**
 *  An interaction that indicates your views's intent to receive game controller
 *  events through the GameController framework.
 *
 *  @discussion
 *  On some platforms controllers can be used to control the general UIKit user
 *  interface and for many views that is the default behavior.  By attaching a
 *  \c GCEventInteraction to one or more of your app's views you get fine
 *  grained control over whether the controller events go through the UIEvent &
 *  UIResponder chain, or if they are decoupled from the UI and all incoming
 *  data is served via Game Controller framework.
 *
 *  On visionOS, while the user is gazing a view with the \c GCEventInteraction,
 *  or one of its subviews, the interaction's \c handledEventTypes property
 *  determines whether the system will deliver game controller events through
 *  the Game Controller framework instead of through the UIEvent & UIResponder
 *  chain.
