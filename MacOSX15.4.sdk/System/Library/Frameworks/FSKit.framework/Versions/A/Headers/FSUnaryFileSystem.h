/// An abstract base class for implementing a minimal file system.
///
/// `FSUnaryFileSystem` is a simplified file system, which works with one ``FSResource`` and presents it as one ``FSVolume``.
///
/// The one volume and its container have a shared state and lifetime, a more constrained life cycle than the ``FSFileSystem`` design flow.
///
/// Implement your app extension by providing a subclass of `FSUnaryFileSystem` as a delegate object.
/// Your delegate also needs to implement the ``FSUnaryFileSystemOperations`` protocol so that it can load resources.

///   - resource: The ``FSResource`` to probe.
///   - replyHandler: A block or closure that your implementation invokes when it finishes the probe or encounters an error. Pass an instance of ``FSProbeResult`` with probe results as the first parameter if your probe operation succeeds. If probing fails, pass an error as the second parameter.

/// Implement this method by inspecting the provided resource and verifying it uses a supported format.
/// If the resource does use a supported format, create a subclass of `FSVolume`, clear the container error state, and invoke the `reply` callback, passing your volume as a parameter.
/// If loading can't proceed, invoke `reply` and send an appropriate error as the second parameter.

///   - resource: An ``FSResource`` to load.
///   - options: An ``FSTaskOptions`` object specifying options to apply when loading the resource. An ``FSUnaryFileSystem`` supports two options: `-f` for "force" and `--rdonly` for read-only. The file system must remember if the read-only option is present.
///   - replyHandler: A block or closure that your implementation invokes when it finishes setting up or encounters an error. Pass a subclass of `FSVolume` as the first parameter if loading succeeds. If loading fails, pass an error as the second parameter.
