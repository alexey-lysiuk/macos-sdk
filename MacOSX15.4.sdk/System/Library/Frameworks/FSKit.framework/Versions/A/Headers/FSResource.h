/// An abstract resource a file system uses to provide data for a volume.

/// `FSResource` is a base class to represent the various possible sources of data for a file system.
/// These range from dedicated storage devices like hard drives and flash storage to network connections, and beyond.
/// Subclasses define behavior specific to a given kind of resource, such as ``FSBlockDeviceResource-c.class`` for disk partition (IOMedia) file systems.
/// These file systems are typical disk file systems such as HFS, APFS, ExFAT, ext2fs, or NTFS.
///
/// A resource's type also determines its life cycle.
/// Resources based on block storage devices come into being when the system probes the media underlying the volumes and container.
/// Other kinds of resources, like those based on URLs, might have different life cycles.
/// For example, a resource based on a `file://` URL might iniitalize when a person uses the "Connect to server" command in the macOS Finder.
///
/// ### Proxying resources
///
/// Some resources, like ``FSBlockDeviceResource``, come in proxy and non-proxy variants.
/// This addresses the issue that opening an external device like `/dev/disk2s1` requires an entitlement.
/// Proxy resources allow unentitled clients of FSKit to describe which disk an ``FSBlockDeviceResource`` should represent.
/// This allows, for example, the `mount(8)` tool to mount FSKit file systems on block devices when run as root.
/// The tool uses a proxy when executing a command like `mount -t ffs /dev/disk2s1 /some/path`, which prevents leaking privileged resource access.
