 *  from the user interaction from the drag gesture. There is a system-defined timeout before the drag session is
 *  failed if the `completion` is not called in time. The `completion` block returns `YES` if the drag session did
 *  prepare successfully prepare, and `NO` otherwise, to allow clients to perform any clean-up if necessary.
