/*!
 * @macro probable_static_if() / improbable_static_if()
 *
 * @brief
 * Returns whether the static if class is true or not,
 * encoding it in code rather than loading globals.
 *
 * @discussion
 * Static "ifs" are meant to provide extremely low overhead
 * enablement or disablement of features based on TEXT patching.
 *
 * It is meant for debugging features, or checkers that happen
 * on really hot paths where loading a global will affect
 * performance in meaningful ways (lock checks, preemption
 * disablement tracking, etc...).
 *
 * @c probable_static_if() versus @c improbable_static_if()
 * affects which direction will take a branch:
 *
 *   key value             |   TRUE   |  FALSE   |    outlining
 *   ----------------------+----------+----------+----------------
 *   probable_static_if    |  nop     |  branch  |  "FALSE" case
 *   improbable_static_if  |  branch  |  nop     |  "TRUE"  case
 *
 * @c static_if() will not outline any code, and will codegen a "nop"
 * for the initial value of the key.
 *
 * There usually is a STARTUP hook that pairs with those
 * static if domains that will toggle enablement based
 * on boot-args or various configurations.
