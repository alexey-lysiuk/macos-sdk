 * it are pointers to the start of all loaded images (usually also

 *
 * The debug header must always be exactly 4096 bytes after VBAR_GL2,
 * or VBAR_EL2 if GXF is not enabled yet. Therefore, any collection
 * of exception handlers that VBAR may point to during bootstrap needs
 * to be followed by a separate debug header.
 *
 * The pointers must always be currently valid virtual addresses, so
 * the entries of some debug headers may undergo some transition during
 * bootstrap, when we switch between address translations (e.g. because
 * we switch away from V=P mappings).
