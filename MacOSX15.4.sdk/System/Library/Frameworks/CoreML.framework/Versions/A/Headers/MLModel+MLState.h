@interface MLModel (MLState)

/// Creates a new state object.
///
/// Core ML framework will allocate the state buffers declared in the model.
///
/// The allocated state buffers are initialized to zeros. To initialize with different values, use `.withMultiArray(for:)` to get the mutable `MLMultiArray`-view to the state buffer.
///
/// It returns an empty state when the model is stateless. One can use the empty state with stateful prediction functions such as `prediction(from:using:)` and those predictions will be stateless. This simplifies the call site which may or may not use a stateful model.
///
/// ```swift
/// // Create state that contains two state buffers: s1 and s2.
/// // Then, initialize s1 to 1.0 and s2 to 2.0.
/// let state = model.newState()
/// state.withMultiArray(for: "s1") { stateMultiArray in
///     stateMultiArray[0] = 1.0
/// }
/// state.withMultiArray(for: "s2") { stateMultiArray in
///     stateMultiArray[0] = 2.0
/// }
/// ```
