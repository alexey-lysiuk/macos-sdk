/*!
	@enum       	MEError
	@abstract		MediaExtension framework error codes.
	@discussion		These error codes are returned in the NSError object in the event a method fails.
	@constant		MEErrorUnsupportedFeature
		Returned if the extension does not support an aspect of the media.
	@constant		MEErrorAllocationFailure
		Returned if the extension cannot allocate memory.
	@constant		MEErrorInvalidParameter
		Returned if the extension received an invalid parameter.
	@constant		MEErrorParsingFailure
		Returned if any type of error occurred while parsing the media.
	@constant		MEErrorInternalFailure
		Returned if the extension encountered an internal operation failure (e.g. code loading).
	@constant		MEErrorPropertyNotSupported
		Returned if the extension encountered a property it does not support reading/writing to.
	@constant		MEErrorNoSuchEdit
		Returned if the plugin track reader is requested to return an edit that is out of range.
	@constant		MEErrorNoSamples
		Returned if the plugin sample cursor cannot be created because there are no samples in the track, or if a loadSampleBufferContainingSamplesToEndCursor request is made that cannot be satisfied.
	@constant		MEErrorLocationNotAvailable
		Returned to indicate a specific sample is not contiguous, spans more than one file, or is for some other reason unsuitable for reading directly from a file. For such samples, clients must call loadSampleBufferContainingSamplesToEndCursor.
	@constant		MEErrorEndOfStream
		Returned if the end of the source file has been reached.
	@constant		MEErrorPermissionDenied
		Returned if an invalid operation is requested by the client on a byte source.
	@constant		MEErrorReferenceMissing
		Returned if a decoder is asked to decode a sample without decoding the required reference frame dependencies first.
