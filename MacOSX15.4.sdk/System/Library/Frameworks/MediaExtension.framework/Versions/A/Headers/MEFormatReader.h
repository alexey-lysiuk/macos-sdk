	Overview

	This file contains the interface/protocol for MediaExtension format readers. Developers who wish to build MediaExtension
	format readers using this API will need to include the required entitlement along with a provisioning profile when building
	their extensions. For more information about public entitlements and provisioning profiles see:
	https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements
	https://developer.apple.com/help/account/manage-provisioning-profiles/create-a-development-provisioning-profile

	MediaExtension Format Reader Entitlement

	The format reader must include the public entitlement key "com.apple.developer.mediaextension.formatreader" with a boolean
	value set to true. A provisioning profile will be needed to use this entitlement.

	MediaExtension Format Reader Info.plist File Information

	The following standard bundle Info.plist keys have significance for MediaExtension format readers:

	- CFBundleVersion
		This version number will be used to select among any duplicate installations of MediaExtension format readers with the
		same ClassImplementationID. The version formatting should follow standard CFBundleVersion guidelines, with any major,
		minor, and update versions having values in the range of 0-255.
	- CFBundleDisplayName
		This name will be displayed to identify the format readers in the System Settings listing of extension format readers.
		The name can be localized using standard bundle localization techniques. If no display name is provided, the system
		will use the file name of the MediaExtension format reader bundle.
	- CFBundleIconName
	- CFBundleIconFile
		The icon referenced here will displayed along with the CFBundleDisplayName in the System Settings listing of extension
		format readers. If no icon is provided, the system will use a generic icon.

	MediaExtension format readers will also need to include two specialized dictionaries in their Info.plist files. One dictionary
	is required and describes ExtensionKit information, while the other is optional and registers the format reader media format
	with the system.

	EXAppExtensionAttributes Dictionary

	The EXAppExtensionAttributes dictionary is required by ExtensionKit. The following keys will be needed for MediaExtension
	format readers (see also MEExtensionPlugin.h):

	- ClassImplementationID
		This should be a string similar to the bundle identifier of the format reader. It should start with the reverse
		domain identifier of the developer to prevent collisions with other developers, and for clarity contain
		".formatreader." and the name of the media format. If the developer envisions multiple variants of the same media
		format, the name should include strings to make each format reader unique. An example might be something like
		"com.mycompany.formatreader.mymediaformat.formatvariant".
	- EXExtensionPointIdentifier
		The string "com.apple.mediaextension.formatreader" (kMEFormatReaderExtensionPointName).
	- EXPrincipalClass
		The name of the format reader factory class, conforming to the MEFormatReaderExtension protocol.
	- MTFileNameExtensionArray
		An array of strings describing the file name extension strings (without the .) of all file types supported
		by the format reader. There should be at least one entry for each type of media file supported.
	- MTUTTypeArray
		An array of strings describing the UTType identifier associated with the media the format reader supports. There
		should be at least one entry for the media type that is supported.
	- ObjectName
		A user-readable string describing the format reader. This string is used for uniquely identifying format readers
		and possibly for debug logging but is typically not visible to users.

	UTExportedTypeDeclarations Dictionary

	The UTExportedTypeDeclarations dictionary is optional and allows the format reader to register its supported format
	from the MTUTTypeArray above with the system so that media files can be recognized and opened by other applications.
	For general information on how to make a UTExportedTypeDeclarations dictionary, see documentation here:
	https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/utexportedtypedeclarations

	- UTTypeDescription
		A user-readable string describing the media "kind". This name will be displayed in Finder. This string can be
		localized by making localized variants of the Info.plist file.
	- UTTypeConformsTo
		An array of UTType identifiers. The first entry should be set to the abstract type for MediaExtension
		format readers, "com.apple.mediaextension-content". This type also conforms to higher level abstract types such as
		"public.movie" and "public.audiovisual-content". Additional types can also be included as well if desired.
	- UTTypeIdentifier
		A UTType identifier string that should match the value in MTUTTypeArray in the EXAppExtensionAttributes dictionary.
	- UTTypeTagSpecification
		Inside the UTTypeTagSpecification dictionary, the public.filename-extension key should have a value matching the
		MTFileNameExtensionArray in the EXAppExtensionAttributes dictionary.
	- public.mime-type
		This key is optional but should be a MIME type that corresponds to the format.

 Overview of MESampleCursor Sample Delivery
 
 An MESampleCursor can return sample data to CoreMedia in one of two ways. Either it can return just information about the sample data location in the media and let CoreMedia do the actual reading of the data, or it can read the data iself and return sample buffers directly.
 
 The MESampleCursor allows CoreMedia to read the data
 ----------------------------------------------------
 
 This is the preferred method to deliver sample data. It allows CoreMedia to optimize data I/O read operations, potentially combining multiple smaller reads into a single larger read for better performance. There are four methods available to deliver the required sample location information.
 
 - sampleLocationReturningError:error
 This is the main method to return sample location information. In order to allow CoreMedia to optimize I/O, the MESampleCursor must provide either this method or the two methods estimatedSampleLocationReturningError: and refineSampleLocation:. For formats where samples are stored in contiguous groups or blocks, this method will be used together with chunkDetailsReturningError:. For formats where samples are stored individually (e.g. video), implementation of chunkDetailsReturningError: is optional.
 
 - chunkDetailsReturningError:error
 For formats where samples are stored in contiguous groups, blocks, or chunks (e.g. audio), this method is used to indicate details about how many samples are stored in each grouping and the sample offset within the group. After determining the chunk information, CoreMedia will then call either sampleLocationReturningError: or estimatedSampleLocationReturningError: followed by refineSampleLocation: to locate individual samples within the chunk.
 
 - estimatedSampleLocationReturningError:error
 In some cases it is not possible to directly determine the sample location and return it through sampleLocationReturningError:. Instead, the sample location must be determined in two steps: a coarse estimatation followed by a refinement operation to find the exact location. This method returns the coarse estimation of the location, and the second step is refineSampleLocation:refinementData: to return the exact location. Both methods must be implemented to support this functionality.
  
 - refineSampleLocation:refinementData:refinementDataLength:refinedLocation:error
 This method returns the exact sample location information as a second step after the coarse estimate from estimatedSampleLocationReturningError:. This method must be implemented together with estimatedSampleLocationReturningError: in order to support the two-step location functionality.
 
 The MESampleCursor reads sample buffers directly
 ------------------------------------------------

 In cases where it is not possible to let CoreMedia read the sample data using location information, the MESampleCursor will need to read the sample data itself using the MEByteSource and deliver sample data buffers to CoreMedia. This is less efficient for data I/O because it does not allow CoreMedia to optimize read operations.
  
 - loadSampleBufferContainingSamplesToEndCursor:completionHandler:
 This method delivers sample buffers directly, so it allows the MESampleCursor full flexibility in reading and unpacking the samples from the media. The MESampleCursor must use the MEByteSource directly to seek and read the sample data. This method can deliver sample buffers either with one sample (e.g. for video tracks) or with blocks of samples (e.g. for audio). It is also suitable for cases where samples must be synthesized using metadata from the media (e.g. for timecode tracks).
 
 Practical Examples
 ------------------
 
 (1) Samples are stored in groups interleaved among other samples
 The MESampleCursor should implement sampleLocationReturningError: and chunkDetailsReturningError: to allow CoreMedia to locate the chunks and find samples inside the chunks.
 
 (2) Samples are stored in blocks interleaved among other samples, but some samples are non-contiguous
 The MESampleCursor should implement sampleLocationReturningError:, chunkDetailsReturningError:, and loadSampleBufferContainingSamplesToEndCursor:. For contiguous samples, sampleLocationReturningError: should return with no error and the samples will be read this way. For non-contiguous samples, sampleLocationReturningError: and chunkDetailsReturningError: should return MEErrorLocationNotAvailable and CoreMedia will then attempt to read the samples using loadSampleBufferContainingSamplesToEndCursor:.
 
 (3) Sample location cannot be directly determined in one step
 If the sample location cannot be determined as a one-step process but is possible using a two-step, "coarse estimate followed by refinement" process, then the MESampleCursor should implement estimatedSampleLocationReturningError: and refineSampleLocation: instead of sampleLocationReturningError:. If determining the sample location does not fit into either the one-step or two-step model, then the MESampleCursor should implement loadSampleBufferContainingSamplesToEndCursor:.
 
 (4) Sample data must be unpacked or prepared in some way before delivering to CoreMedia
 If the sample data cannot be read directly by CoreMedia, then the MESampleCursor should implement loadSampleBufferContainingSamplesToEndCursor: to read the data itself, unpack or prepare it as appropriate, and deliver it in sample buffers.

The exact sample location will then be requested in a subsequent call to refineSampleLocation. It is possible to indicate that no refinement is necessary by returning a value for refinementDataLocation that has a zero length. If a non-zero length refinement location is returned, the range for the estimated sample location returned must fully cover the refined range returned by refineSampleLocation and the refinement data location. Note: Implementing estimatedSampleLocationReturningError also requires implementing refineSampleLocation.
