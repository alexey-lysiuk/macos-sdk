	Overview

	This file contains the interface/protocol for MediaExtension video decoders. Developers who wish to build MediaExtension
	video decoders using this API will need to include the required entitlement along with a provisioning profile when building
	their extensions. For more information about public entitlements and provisioning profiles see:
	https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements
	https://developer.apple.com/help/account/manage-provisioning-profiles/create-a-development-provisioning-profile

	MediaExtension Video Decoder Entitlement

	The video decoder must include the public entitlement key "com.apple.developer.mediaextension.videodecoder" with a boolean
	value set to true. A provisioning profile will be needed to use this entitlement.

	MediaExtension Video Decoder Info.plist File Information

	The following standard bundle Info.plist keys have significance for MediaExtension video decoders:
 
	- CFBundleVersion
 		This version number will be used to select among any duplicate installations of MediaExtension video decoders with the
		same ClassImplementationID. The version formatting should follow standard CFBundleVersion guidelines, with any major,
		minor, and patch versions all having values in the range of 0-255.
	- CFBundleDisplayName
		This name will be displayed to identify the video decoder in the System Settings listing of extension video decoders.
		The name can be localized using standard bundle localization techniques. If no display name is provided, the system
		will use the file name of the MediaExtension video decoder bundle.
	- CFBundleIconName
	- CFBundleIconFile
		The icon referenced here will displayed along with the CFBundleDisplayName in the System Settings listing of extension
		video decoders. If no icon is provided, the system will use a generic icon.
 
	MediaExtension video decoders will also need to include a specialized EXAppExtensionAttributes dictionary in their Info.plist
	files describing ExtensionKit information.

	EXAppExtensionAttributes Dictionary

	The EXAppExtensionAttributes dictionary is required by ExtensionKit. The following keys will be needed for ExtensionKit
	video decoders (see also MEExtensionPlugin.h):

	- ClassImplementationID
		This should be a string similar to the bundle identifier of the video decoder. It should start with the reverse domain
		identifier of the developer to prevent collisions with other developers, and for clarity contain ".videodecoder." and
		the name of the codec. If the developer envisions multiple variants of the same decoder, the name should include strings
		to make each video decoder unique. An example might be something like "com.mycompany.videodecoder.mycodec.codecvariant".
	- EXExtensionPointIdentifier
		The string "com.apple.mediaextension.videodecoder" (kMEVideoDecoderExtensionPointName).
	- EXPrincipalClass
		The name of the video decoder factory class, conforming to the MEVideoDecoderExtension protocol.
	- CodecInfo
		An array of one or more dictionaries describing the codecs that the decoder supports. Each dictionary must include the
		following keys:
		* CodecType
			A string describing the four-character code of the codec that the decoder supports. Each string should be exactly four
			characters long and use ASCII character set encoding.
		* CodecName
			A user-readable string describing the name of the codec format. This string might be displayed as format information for
			the video track in a player application.
	- ObjectName
		A user-readable string describing the decoder. This string is used for uniquely identifying video decoders and possibly for
		debug logging but is typically not visible to users.

	MediaExtension Video Decoder Call Flow and Life Cycle Overview

	MediaExtension video decoder operation and life cycle are closely tied to VTDecompressionSession.
	See <VideoToolbox/VTDecompressionSession.h> for more details on this interface.

	Creation:
		An instance of an MEVideoDecoderExtension factory object is created the first time a given decoder is opened
		by the VideoToolbox in a process. The videoDecoderWithCodecType: method on the MEVideoDecoderExtension
		object will be called once for each decoder instance needed. The decoder can evaluate the provided codecType
		and CMVideoFormatDescription at this point and confirm whether it is able to decode the specified format. If the
		decoder cannot decode the format, the factory routine should return MEErrorUnsupportedFeature. This sequence of
		calls will happen inside of VTDecompressionSessionCreate.

	Pixel Buffer Requirement Configuration:
		At any point after instantiation, the decoder can call back into the provided MEVideoDecoderPixelBufferManager object
		to notify the VideoToolbox of its output pixelBuffer requirements. The decoder extension may make multiple calls if
		output requirements change in response to properties being set or due to observed bitstream characteristics.

	Property calls
		Properties can be queried or set on the decoder at any time, before, during or after frame decode, unless otherwise
		noted. These calls generally correspond to calls to VTSessionSetProperty and VTSessionCopyProperty being made
		on the VTDecompressionSession which opened the decoder. There may be cases where the VideoToolbox directly sets or
		queries properties as well.

	Frame Decoding:
		Calls to decodeFrameFromSampleBuffer: will be serialized.  A new frame will not be sent to the decoder until the last
		decodeFrameFromSampleBuffer: has returned, but may be submitted before the decodeFrameFromSampleBuffer: completion
		handler is called if the decode is happening asynchronously. These calls correspond to VTDecompressionSessionDecodeFrame
		calls on the parent VTDecompressionSession.

		Video decoders must write their output frames into CVPixelBuffers allocated through the MEVideoDecoderPixelBufferManager
		createPixelBufferAndReturnError: interface. Returning CVPixelBuffers from any other source may result in degraded performance
		or other issues.

		If the decoder's internal decoding queue is full, and it cannot decode more frames, it should return
		NO when the isReadyForMoreMediaData property is queried.  This property should return YES again when the decoder
		is able to accept new frames -- generally after an earlier asynchronous frame decode is completed.

	Format Description Changes:
		If there is a change in the format description on incoming CMSampleBuffers, the VideoToolbox will confirm whether the
		decoder is able to transition to the new format description by calling the canAcceptFormatDescription: method. If this
		method returns "NO", the decoder will usually be closed and a new instance will be created for the new format description.
		This call may either be triggered by a call to VTDecompressionSessionCanAcceptFormatDescription, or be initiated directly by
		the VideoToolbox if a format description change is seen on incoming CMSampleBuffers.
