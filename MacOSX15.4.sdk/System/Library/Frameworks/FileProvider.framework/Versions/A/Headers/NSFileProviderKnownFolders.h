#pragma mark - Claiming replication of known folders

@interface NSFileProviderManager (KnownFolders)

/** Request the specified known folders to be synced by this domain.

 This method allows the provider to claim a set of known folders described by the non-null
 properties of the knownFolders parameter. The system will only enable sync for those folders
 in that domain if the set of locations is valid and if the user agrees.

 This API should only be called as a result of the user requesting, via UI in the provider's application,
 that they wish to start syncing the Desktop and Document folders.
 If the provider chooses to implement a UI which invokes this API, the provider should also implement a UI
 for the user to request to stop syncing the Desktop and Document folders,
 using the `-[NSFileProviderManager releaseKnownFolders:localizedReason:completionHandler:]` method.

 The reason specified in this call is a custom string that the provider can pass and will be
 presented to the user as a way to explain why it is claiming those known folders. One suggested
 phrasing would be:

 > Keep your Desktop & Documents in sync with <Provider name> and access them from other devices and from <Provider website>.

 If the user denies the transition of the known folders, the call will fail with `NSUserCancelledError`.

 The call will fail if:
 - one or more locations are not folders
 - multiple locations are backed by the same folder
 - a known folder doesn't live on the same volume as the root of the domain
 - the known folders don't have the same parent folder
 - ...

 Currently, only claiming both ~/Desktop and ~/Documents together is allowed.
