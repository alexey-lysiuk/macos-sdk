This document describes differences between the 5.32.0 release and the 5.34.0
release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.30.0, first read
perl5320delta, which describes differences between 5.30.0 and 5.32.0.

.ie n .SS """qr/{,n}/"" is now accepted"
.el .SS "\f(CWqr/{,n}/\fP is now accepted"
.IX Subsection "qr/{,n}/ is now accepted"
An empty lower bound is now accepted for regular expression quantifiers,
like \f(CW\*(C`{,3}\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Blanks freely allowed within but adjacent to curly braces"
.IX Subsection "Blanks freely allowed within but adjacent to curly braces"
(in double-quotish contexts and regular expression patterns)
.PP
This means you can write things like \f(CW\*(C`\ex{\ FFFC\ }\*(C'\fR if you like.  This
applies to all such constructs, namely \f(CW\*(C`\eb{}\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\eg{}\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\ek{}\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eN{}\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\eo{}\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`\ex{}\*(C'\fR; as well as the regular expression
quantifier \f(CW\*(C`{\f(CIm\f(CW,\f(CIn\f(CW}\*(C'\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`\ep{}\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\eP{}\*(C'\fR retain their
already-existing, even looser, rules mandated by the Unicode standard
(see \*(L"Properties accessible through \ep{} and \eP{}\*(R" in perluniprops).
.PP
This ability is in effect regardless of the presence of the \f(CW\*(C`/x\*(C'\fR
regular expression pattern modifier.
.PP
Additionally, the comma in a regular expression braced quantifier may
have blanks (tabs or spaces) before and/or after the comma, like
\&\f(CW\*(C`qr/a{\ 5,\ 7\ }/\*(C'\fR.

It is now possible to specify octal literals with \f(CW\*(C`0o\*(C'\fR prefixes,
as in \f(CW\*(C`0o123_456\*(C'\fR, parallel to the existing construct to specify
hexadecimal literal \f(CW\*(C`0x\f(CIddddd\f(CW\*(C'\fR and binary literal \f(CW\*(C`0b\f(CIddddd\f(CW\*(C'\fR.
Also, the builtin \f(CW\*(C`oct()\*(C'\fR function now accepts this new syntax.

be left on, resulting in a possibly corrupt result in \f(CW\*(C`VAR\*(C'\fR.

Magic is now called correctly for stacked file test operators.

The \f(CW\*(C`@ary = split(...)\*(C'\fR optimization no longer switches in the target
array as the value stack.

On Win32, \f(CW\*(C`waitpid(\-1, WNOHANG)\*(C'\fR could sometimes have a very large

\&\f(CW\*(C`MARK\*(C'\fR and hence \f(CW\*(C`items\*(C'\fR are now correctly initialized in \f(CW\*(C`BOOT\*(C'\fR XSUBs.

Some list assignments involving \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR on the left-hand side were
over-optimized and produced incorrect results.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.
.PP
Many of the changes included in this version originated in the \s-1CPAN\s0 modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire \s-1CPAN\s0 community for
helping Perl to flourish.

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  There may also be information at
<http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
