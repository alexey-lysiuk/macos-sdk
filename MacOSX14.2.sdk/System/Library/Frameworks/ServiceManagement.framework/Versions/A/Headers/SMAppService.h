 * An SMAppService is used to control helper executables that live inside of an app's main bundle.

 * @discussion
 * For SMAppServices initialized as LoginItems, the register and unregister APIs provide a replacement for
 * SMLoginItemSetEnabled.
 *
 * Apps that use SMAppService APIs must be code signed.
 *
 * For SMAppServices initialized as LaunchAgents, the register and unregister APIs provide a replacement
 * for installing plists in ~/Library/LaunchAgents or /Library/LaunchAgents.
 *
 * For SMAppServices initialized as LaunchDaemons, the register and unregister APIs provide a replacement
 * for installing plists in /Library/LaunchDaemons. Apps that contain LaunchDaemons must be notarized.
 *
 * Legacy LaunchDaemons installed in /Library/LaunchDaemons will continue to be bootstrapped without
 * explicit approval in System Settings since writing to /Library is protected  with filesystem permissions.
 *
 * If an app updates either the plist or the executable for a LaunchAgent or LaunchDaemon, the SMAppService
 * must be re-registered or it may not launch. It is recommended to also call unregister before
 * re-registering if the executable has been changed.
