/// A class that manages asset packs.

/// The first time that your code refers to the shared manager, Background Assets considers that your app is opting into automatic system management of your asset packs.
/// - Important: When using the asset-pack manager, make sure that you also adopt the corresponding managed extension protocol. For apps that use Apple hosting, the corresponding protocol is `SKDownloaderExtension` from StoreKit. For other apps, the corresponding protocol is ``BAManagedDownloaderExtension``. Not adopting the right protocol is a programmer error.

If a non-`nil` value is provided to the block’s `error` parameter, then the asset pack is **not** guaranteed to be available locally. You can optionally monitor download progress by attaching a delegate object to `delegate`.

Unlike ``BAAssetPackManager/contentsAtPath:searchingInAssetPackWithIdentifier:options:error:`` and ``BAAssetPackManager/fileDescriptorForPath:searchingInAssetPackWithIdentifier:error:``, this method supports retrieving entire directories—including packages—in which case it merges the corresponding slices of the shared logical directory from all downloaded asset packs that contain such slices.

/// - Parameters:
///   - path: The relative file path.
///   - error: A pointer to an error that will be set if an error occurs.
/// - Warning: Don’t persist the returned URL beyond the lifetime of the current process.
/// - Warning: This method is less efficient than are ``BAAssetPackManager/contentsAtPath:searchingInAssetPackWithIdentifier:options:error:`` and ``BAAssetPackManager/fileDescriptorForPath:searchingInAssetPackWithIdentifier:error:``; use those methods instead if you can do so. In particular, this method shouldn’t be used to get the URL to the root of the shared asset-pack namespace. Don’t use this method to block the main thread.
/// - Note: This method will return a well formed URL even if no item exists at the specified relative path in any asset pack, in which case any attempts to get its contents—whether it’s a file or a directory—will fail.
