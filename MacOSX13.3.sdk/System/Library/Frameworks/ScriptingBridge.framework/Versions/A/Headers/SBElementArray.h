/// `SBElementArray` is subclass of `NSMutableArray` that manages collections of
/// related
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/scriptingbridge/sbobject>
/// objects. For example, when you ask the Finder for a list of disks, or ask
/// iTunes for a list of playlists, you get the result back as an
/// `SBElementArray` containing Scripting Bridge objects representing those
/// items.
///
/// `SBElementArray` defines methods beyond those of
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/foundation/nsarray> for
/// obtaining individual objects. In addition to
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/foundation/nsarray/1417555-objectatindex>,
/// `SBElementArray` also defines ``SBElementArray/objectWithName:``,
///  ``SBElementArray/objectWithID:``, and ``SBElementArray/objectAtLocation:``.

/// ## Subclassing Notes

/// Returns the object in the array with the given name.
///
/// This method is provided as an alternative
/// to<doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/foundation/nsarray/1417555-objectatindex>
/// for applications where a name is available instead of (or in addition to) an
/// index. A name is generally more stable than an index. For example, it is
/// typically more useful to identify a mailbox in Mail by its name than by its
/// index in the list of mailboxes.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - name: The name of one of the receiver's objects.
///
/// - Returns: A reference to the designated object or `nil` if the object
/// couldn’t be found.
- (ObjectType) objectWithName:(NSString *)name;

/// Returns the object in the array with the given identifier.
///
/// This method is provided as an alternative to
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/foundation/nsarray/1417555-objectatindex>
/// for applications where an identifier is available instead of (or in addition
/// to) an index. A unique ID is generally more stable than an index. For
/// example, it may be more useful to identify a contact in Address Book by its
/// identifier (which doesn't change over time) than by its index in the list of
/// contacts (which can change as contacts are added or removed).
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - identifier: The identifier of one of the receiver's objects.
///
/// - Returns: A reference to the identified object or `nil` if could not be
/// found.
- (ObjectType) objectWithID:(id)identifier;

/// Returns the object at the given location in the receiver.
///
/// This method is a generalization of
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/foundation/nsarray/1417555-objectatindex>
/// for applications where the "index" is not simply an integer. For example,
/// Finder can specify objects using a
/// <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/foundation/nsurl> object as a
/// location. In OSA this is known as "absolute position," a generalization of
/// the notion of “index” in Foundation—it could be an integer, but it doesn't
/// have to be. A single object may even have a number of different "absolute
/// position" values depending on the container.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - loc: An object that specifies the absolute position of the object within
/// the array. It can be an integer index, a list of coordinates, a URL, or
/// other determinant. See the discussion for clarification.
///
/// - Returns: A reference to the ``SBObject`` object identified by `loc` or
/// `nil` if the object couldn’t be located.

/// Returns an array containing the results of sending the specified message to
/// each object in the receiver.
///
/// The method identified by `selector` must not take any arguments and must
/// return an Objective-C object. It should not have the side effect of
/// modifying the receiving array. The order of the items in the result array
/// corresponds to the order of the items in the original array.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - selector: A selector identifying the message to be sent to each object in
/// the array.
///
/// - Returns: A new array containing the results of sending the `selector`
/// message to each object in the receiver, starting with the first object and
/// continuing through the element array to the last object.

/// The method identified by `selector` must take a single argument—whose value
/// is provided in `argument`—and must return an object. It should not have the
/// side effect of modifying the receiving array. The order of the items in the
/// result array corresponds to the order of the items in the original array.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - selector: A selector identifying the message to be sent to each object in
/// the array.
///
///   - argument: The value for the parameter of the message identified by
/// `selector`.
///
/// - Returns: A new array containing the results of sending the `selector`
/// message to each object in the receiver, starting with the first object and
/// continuing through the element array to the last object.

/// Forces evaluation of the receiver, causing the real object to be returned
/// immediately.
///
/// This method forces the evaluation of the current object reference (the
/// receiver), resulting in the return of the referenced object. By default,
/// Scripting Bridge deals with references to objects until you actually request
/// some concrete data from them or until you call the `get` method.
///
/// - Returns: The object referenced by the receiver.
