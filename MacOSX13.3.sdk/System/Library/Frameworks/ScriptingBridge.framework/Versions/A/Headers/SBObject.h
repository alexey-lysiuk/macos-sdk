/// The `SBObject` class declares methods that can be invoked on any object in a
/// scriptable application. It defines methods for getting elements and
/// properties of an object, as well as setting a given object to a new value.
///
/// Each `SBObject` is built around an object specifier, which tells Scripting
/// Bridge how to locate the object. Therefore, you can think of an `SBObject`
/// as a reference to an object in an target application rather than an object
/// itself. To bypass this reference-based approach and force evaluation, use
/// the ``SBObject/get`` method.
///
/// Typically, rather than create `SBObject` instances explictly, you receive
/// `SBObject` objects by calling methods of an ``SBApplication`` subclass. For
/// example, if you wanted to get an `SBObject` representing the current iTunes
/// track, you would use code like this (where `iTunesTrack` is a subclass of
/// `SBObject`):
///
/// ```objc
/// iTunesApplication *iTunes = [SBApplication applicationWithBundleIdentifier:@"com.apple.iTunes"];
/// iTunesTrack *track = [iTunes currentTrack];
/// ```
///
/// You can discover the names of dynamically generated classes such as
/// `iTunesApplication` and `iTunesTrack` by examining the header file created
/// by the `sdp` tool. Alternatively, you give these variables the dynamic
/// Objective-C type `id`.
