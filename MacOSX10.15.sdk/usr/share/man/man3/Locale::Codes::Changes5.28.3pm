Locale::Codes::Changes \- details changes to Locale::Codes
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
This describes the changes made to modules in the Locale-Codes
distribution.  Major changes are marked with asterisks (*).  For the
most part, all modules have remained backward compatible at every
release, but occasionally a change is made which is backward
incompatible. These are marked with an exclamation mark (!).
.PP
As of 3.00, the codes are autogenerated from the standards. With each
release, codes will be re-generated and tested to see if any code
changed. Any time there are any changes to the codes, it will be
flagged below with a change: \s-1NEW CODE\s0(s).
.PP
I intend to check for new codes four times a year (March, June,
September, December). I will also check on request, so if a code
changes that you use, feel free to contact me.  Any time there are new
codes, I will add them to the module and release a new version.

.IX Item "(*) Deprecated in core"
Because correct usage of any of the Locale::Codes modules requires that
they be kept up-to-date, I have long felt that it should not be distributed
as a core module.  After discussion on the perl5\-porters list, it is agreed,
and the deprecation process has been started.
.Sp
Thanks to p5p\-porters (especially Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsaker) for discussion
and guidance.

.IX Item "Fixed the default error condition in legacy modules."
With the addition of the \s-1OO\s0 module, better error handling was added (and it
was on by default).  The non-OO (legacy) modules did not report errors, so
code that uses them, would now behave differently if invalid data were
passed in.
.Sp
I have turned off error handling by default in the legacy modules.  The
show_errors method was added to each of the non-OO modules to report errors
if desired.

.IX Item "(*) Rewrote as OO module"
The core module (Locale::Codes) is now an \s-1OO\s0 module that can be used
directly.  All of the other modules (Locale::Codes::TYPE) are still
the older functional interfaces and remain unchanged.
.IP "\fBAdded some constants\fR" 4
.IX Item "Added some constants"
Historically, the constant names used to identify the codesets have been
named inconsistently.  The original constants for codesets are:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   Type      Constants
\&
\&   country   LOCALE_CODE_*
\&   currency  LOCALE_CURR_*
\&   language  LOCALE_LANG_*
\&
\&   script    LOCALE_SCRIPT_*
\&   langfam   LOCALE_LANGFAM_*
\&   langvar   LOCALE_LANGVAR_*
\&   langext   LOCALE_LANGEXT_*
.Ve
.Sp
For consistencies sake, I have added some new codes (which are otherwise
identical to the irregularly named codes):
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&   country   LOCALE_COUNTRY_*
\&   currency  LOCALE_CURRENCY_*
\&   language  LOCALE_LANGUAGE_*
.Ve
.Sp
Going forward, all constants will include the full name of the code type.
.IP "Non-OO modules are now generated" 4
.IX Item "Non-OO modules are now generated"
All non-OO modules are now automatically generated.  This will make it easier
to keep them 100% consistent as well as making it easier to add new types
of code sets.
.Sp
All of the documentation for them is also generated except for the description
of the code sets.  That has been moved into the Locale::Codes::Types document.
.IP "Fixed a bug where constants were not exported" 4
.IX Item "Fixed a bug where constants were not exported"
Some of the constants for some of the newer code sets were not exported properly.
This was fixed when I started generating the non-OO modules, but was reported
(after I had already fixed it in development) as \s-1RT 119741 .\s0

.IX Item "Filled out LOCALE_LANG_TERM codeset"
The terminologic language codes only included codes from languages where
the \s-1ISO\s0 specified both a bibliographic code and a terminologic code.  If
both are not specified, the better solution was to use the code for both
code sets.  Prompted by a suggestion by Jarkko Hietaniemi.

a huge layer of complexity to maintaining the set, which is not
worth doing considering that the set is deprecated.  As such, the

.IX Item "FIPS-10 country codes deprecated"
The \s-1FIPS\-10\s0 document is being withdrawn.  It was deprecated in 2008,
and is being updated now only until all the agencies that use it have
switched to something else.  The current version no longer lists the
long names for countries.  These long names (such as 'Republic of
Albania' for Albania) only appeared in the old \s-1FIPS\-10\s0 document which
is no longer available, so they are no longer available in this module.
.Sp
I will continue to support the \s-1FIPS\-10\s0 codeset as long as it is available,
but at that point, it will be withdrawn immediately.  If an official
end-of-life date is announced, I will include a notice here.  Otherwise, support
for the codeset will be discontinued when the document is withdrawn.
.Sp
You are encouraged to no longer use the \s-1FIPS\-10\s0 codeset.
.IP "\fBDomain country codes now come from \s-1ISO 3166\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "Domain country codes now come from ISO 3166"
The \s-1IANA\s0 domain codes have changed slightly.  The \s-1IANA\s0 no longer
publishes a list of countries associated with their codes.  Instead,
they use the \s-1ISO 3166\s0 codes and country names.  However, they support
a few non-standard codes, so I will continue to maintain this codeset.
The domain codes are now lowercase to correspond to the \s-1ISO 3166\s0 codes.

.IP "\fB(!) Changed XXX_code2code behavior slightly\fR" 4
.IX Item "(!) Changed XXX_code2code behavior slightly"
In previous versions, passing in the same code set for both code set
arguments would automatically return undef. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   country_code2code(\*(Aqbo\*(Aq,LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2,LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2);
\&      => undef
.Ve
.Sp
This doesn't seem like reasonable behavior, so it has been changed
to allow the same code set:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   country_code2code(\*(Aqbo\*(Aq,LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2,LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2);
\&      => \*(Aqbo\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
Note that if an invalid code is passed in, undef will still be
returned:

\&   country_code2code(\*(Aqbol\*(Aq,LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2,LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2);
\&      => undef

.IP "\fBAdded many semi-private routines\fR" 4
.IX Item "Added many semi-private routines"
Previous versions had only two semi-private routines: rename_country
and alias_code which had the ability to modify the internal data in
a couple very limited ways. It was requested (in an anonymous posting
by someone named Steve and also by Steve Hay) that better support
for modifying internal data, so a full set of routines were added.
.Sp
The full set of routines includes:
.Sp

.IX Item "(*) New maintainer"
From 1997 to 2004, Locale::Codes was maintained by Neil
Bowers. Unfortunately, no updates were made from June 2004 to January
2010. During that time, a number of changes have been made to the
standards since then, so the data included was out-of-date.
.Sp
I contacted Neil to get his permission to assume maintenance of
the module, and he kindly agreed.
.IP "\fB(*) (!) All codes are generated from standards\fR" 4
.IX Item "(*) (!) All codes are generated from standards"
All of the values returned by the various functions are now values
directly from the standards. This means that the values returned in
the 2.xx series are not necessarily the same as the values returned
here.
.Sp
As an example, the \s-1ISO 3166\s0 standard which lists country codes refers
to the country associated with the code \*(L"bo\*(R" as \*(L"Bolivia,
Plurinational State of\*(R", so that is what is returned. In the 2.xx
series, \*(L"Bolivia\*(R" was returned.  Also, the country names vary from one
standard to another. So the code \*(L"bol\*(R" which is maintained by the
United Nations returns the name of the country as \*(L"Bolivia
(Plurinational State of)\*(R". Some common aliases have been added, so you
can still request a code associated with a county name \*(L"Bolivia\*(R".
.Sp
Since the data comes from the standards, some \*(L"incorrect\*(R" values are
no longer supported. For example, 2.07 treated \*(L"Zaire\*(R" as an alias for
\&\*(L"Congo\*(R", but the country changed it's name, and \*(L"Zaire\*(R" is not in the
standard, so it has been dropped in 3.00.

\&\s-1FIPS 10\s0 country codes (requested in \s-1RT 1755\s0)

.Sp
Numeric currency codes (requested in \s-1RT 18797\s0)
.IP "\fB(*) (!) Locale::Script changed\fR" 4
.IX Item "(*) (!) Locale::Script changed"
In 2.xx, Locale::Script assigned scripts to country codes, which is \s-1NOT\s0
how it is done currently in the standards. It appears that an older version
of \s-1ISO 15924\s0 did this, but I haven't found an old version to confirm
that, and in any case, that is not the case in the current standards.
.Sp
As a result, the Locale::Script module is completely incompatible with
the 2.xx version with respect to the types of codes it supports. None of
the old codes will work.
.IP "\fBAdded missing functions\fR" 4
.IX Item "Added missing functions"
I've added in some functions which were \*(L"missing\*(R" previously (since there was
only one set of codes supported, the code2code functions didn't apply):
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   language_code2code
\&   currency_code2code
.Ve
.Sp
so the interfaces for each type of codes are consistent.
.IP "\fB(!) Dropped support for _alias_code\fR" 4
.IX Item "(!) Dropped support for _alias_code"
In Locale::Country, _alias_code was an allowed, but deprecated function
which was documented to be supported in the 2.xx series. I've removed it.
.IP "\fB(!) All functions return the standard value\fR" 4
.IX Item "(!) All functions return the standard value"
code2country (and other equivalent functions) now returns the name of
the country specified in the standard (if the different standards
refer to the country by different variations in the name, the results
will differ based on the \s-1CODESET\s0)
.IP "\fB(!) rename_country function altered\fR" 4
.IX Item "(!) rename_country function altered"
The rename_country function from 2.07 would guess the \s-1CODESET\s0 (unlike
all other functions which used a default of \s-1LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2\s0). The
guess can cause problems since (with the addition of \s-1FIPS\s0) codes may
appear in different codesets for different countries. The behavior has
been changed to be the same as other functions (default to
\&\s-1LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2\s0).
