 @abstract Class representing a USB controller in a virtual machine.
 @discussion
    VZUSBController should not be instantiated directly.
    USB controllers are first configured on the VZVirtualMachineConfiguration through a subclass of VZUSBControllerConfiguration.
    When a VZVirtualMachine is created from the configuration, the USB controllers are available through the VZVirtualMachine.usbControllers property.
    The real type of VZUSBController corresponds to the type used by the configuration.
    For example, a VZXHCIControllerConfiguration leads to a device of type VZXHCIController.
